# Rainfall-Prediction-Classifier
My final data science project: As a data scientist, I am responsible for building a model that can predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The dataset provided includes various weather features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

I will demonstrate my data science and machine learning skills by performing the following tasks, each of which includes specific steps:

+ Explore and prepare the dataset: Feature engineering and cleaning.

* Build a classifier pipeline: Model selection, training, and optimization.

* Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance: Interpret metrics and visualizations.
